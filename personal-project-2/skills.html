        <h1>Skill Highlights</h1>
        <p>
          My Skills As I continue my journey in the tech world, I’ve developed a
          diverse set of skills that allow me to take on different challenges,
          both in web development and IT support. Here’s a snapshot of my skill
          set:
        </p>
        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: I have a solid understanding of the
            fundamentals and have built small projects to apply these skills in
            real-world scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python: I’m also learning Python, focusing on using it for web
            applications and backend development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>IT Support</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Technical troubleshooting: With hands-on experience in providing IT
            support, I’ve solved various hardware and software issues for
            individuals and small businesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Network setup and maintenance: Assisting clients with setting up and
            maintaining networks is another area where I’ve put my technical
            knowledge to use.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Prompt Engineering</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I have foundational knowledge in prompt engineering, which allows me
            to leverage AI and machine learning tools to generate better, more
            accurate results.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Construction Experience</h2>
        <li>
          My background in construction has provided me with strong project
          management, budgeting, and leadership skills—qualities that transfer
          well into my tech work. I’m experienced in overseeing complex projects
          from start to finish, ensuring they’re delivered on time and on
          budget.
        </li>
        <h2>Additional Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Typing speed: With a typing speed of 60 words per minute, I can
            efficiently handle various tasks that require quick typing and data
            entry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Problem-solving: Whether in construction or tech, problem-solving
            has always been a core part of my skill set.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I’m continuously learning and expanding my skills, with the goal of
          becoming a proficient full-stack developer and tech entrepreneur. If
          you have a project or challenge where these skills can be of value,
          feel free to reach out!
